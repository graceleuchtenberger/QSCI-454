N represents total number of salamanders in the trial. P represents probability of death at the level of toxicant in the experiment. X is the number of dead salamanders at the end of the trial. 
```{r}
x <- 10
p <- 0.5
N <- 20

#get prob for single outcome
dbinom(x=x,
       prob = p,
       size = N)

#get prob for range of outcomes
x <- 0:N

prob <- dbinom(x=x,
               prob = p,
               size = N)
probwithin <- prob[8:12]
probwithin
obs10 <- sum(probwithin)
